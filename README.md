# Heart-Diseases-Classification
Heart diseases remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide, claiming countless lives each year. As the scale of this global health challenge continues to grow, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions to detect and prevent heart attacks proactively. This is where advanced machine learning classifiers can help greatly.

For this project, my goal is to find out the relationship between the glucose levels in one's blood, and the chances of having a heart attack. For this purpose, I used a Heart Disease Classification dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bharath011/heart-disease-classification-dataset?resource=download). 

This dataset comprises a total of 1319 samples and contains nine fields, with eight of them serving as input variables and one acting as the output field.
The input fields encompass a range of essential parameters, including age, gender, heart rate (impulse), systolic blood pressure (pressure high), diastolic blood pressure (pressure low), blood sugar (glucose), CK-MB (kcm), and Test-Troponin (troponin). These variables are carefully selected to represent significant physiological and clinical indicators that may contribute to the occurrence of heart attacks.

The output field, of utmost importance, pertains to the presence of a heart attack (class), thoughtfully divided into two distinct categories: "negative" and "positive." A "negative" classification signifies the absence of a heart attack, while a "positive" classification indicates the presence of a heart attack.
